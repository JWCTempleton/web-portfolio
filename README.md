# web-portfolio
This is my web portfolio.

I used flex grid for the layout and everything is written using css, I didn't have any javascript elements on here. 

This layout scales from large desktop monitors down to small phone screens. 

Beyond using this as an opportunity to learn about the basics of web development, I wanted to practice modern evolutions of the basics as well.

To that end, I used SCSS compiled through a node package as css as well as other node packages that can be seen in the package.json file.

I really, really enjoyed playing around with node and using packages like autoprefixer to solve problems that I had been concerned with (for example trying out modern css animations and being frustrated when it worked in chrome but not on another browser).

I also really enjoyed learning about node scripts, very cool.
